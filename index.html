        <h1>Chromium Bug Issue 766433</h1>
        <h3>What steps will reproduce the problem?</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Open a website with a service worker that handles requests with a FetchEvent Listener and responds with FetchEvent.respondWith(), let it install and activate;</li>
            <li>Install any extension that uses webRequest API and log the callback for events of chrome.webRequest.onHeadersReceived;</li>
            <li>Open a fresh tab, access the website on which the service worker is registered from step 1.</li>
        </ol>

        <br>

        <h3>What is the expected result?</h3>
        <p>
            The extension should trigger a webRequest.onHeadersReceived upon loading the Response sent by event.respondWith() on the Service Worker, and log its details, having a frameId >= 0.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>What happens instead of that?</h3>
        <p>
            chrome.webRequest.onHeadersReceived fires but mantains the frameId = -1, even if you navigate between pages.
        </p>

        <br>
            <p>
                <strong>If you Bypass for Network on DevTools > Application > Service Worker, it works as intended, having frameId >= 0 for first load and also navigations</strong>
            </p>
        <br>

        <script>
            (function() {
                if(!"serviceWorker" in navigator)
                    return false;

                navigator.serviceWorker.register("/service-worker.js", { "scope": "/" }).then(function() {
                    let readyHtml = document.createElement("p");

                    let innerText = "<strong>Service Worker is registered, now open a fresh tab and then type the address to this site and enter: " + window.location.href + "</strong>";
                    innerText+= "<br> Also try accessing <a href='example_2.html'>example_2.html</a> to see the frameId not changing from -1";

                    readyHtml.innerHTML = innerText;

                    document.body.appendChild(readyHtml);
                });
            })();
